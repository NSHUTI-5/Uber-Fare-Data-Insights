## 🧾 Methodology

### 1. Data Understanding and Preparation
- **📥 Downloaded Dataset**: [Uber Fares on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- **🔍 Performed EDA** using Python (Pandas & Matplotlib)
- **🧹 Cleaned Data**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates
- **📤 Exported CSV** for Power BI usage

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics (mean, median, std. dev.)
- Fare distribution and outlier detection
- Correlations: fare vs. distance, time of day, etc.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Extracted features: `Hour`, `Day`, `Month`
- Added `Day of Week`, `Peak/Off-Peak` labels
- Encoded categorical variables

### 4. Power BI Analysis
- Imported cleaned dataset into Power BI
- Created dynamic visualizations:
  - Fare trends by hour/day/month
  - Peak ride periods
  - Ride duration comparisons

### 5. Dashboard Design
- Interactive filters (Time, Fare Ranges, etc.)
- Visuals used:
  - Bar charts, Boxplots, Time series graphs
  - Map for ride locations (if coordinates available)

## 📊 Key Insights

- Highest fares occur during late-night hours and weekends
- Longer distances correlate with higher fares but not linearly
- Peak activity between 6 PM – 9 PM across weekdays
- Seasonal variations influence fare averages
